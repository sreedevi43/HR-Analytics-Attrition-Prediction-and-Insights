 HR Analytics - Predict Employee Attrition
 -------------------------------------------
 Objective: Use analytics to understand the main causes of employee resignation and predict future
 attrition.
 Tools: Python (Pandas, Seaborn), Power BI, Sklearn
 Mini Guide:
 Perform EDA on HR data (department-wise attrition, salary bands, promotions)
 Build a classification model (Logistic Regression or Decision Tree)
 Visualize attrition factors using Power BI
 Perform SHAP value analysis to explain model predictions
 Deliverables:
 Power BI dashboard
 Model accuracy report + confusion matrix

üìå Project Overview
----------------------
This project focuses on predicting and preventing employee attrition using HR analytics. It combines exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning modeling, and interactive dashboards to provide both predictive power and business insights.

Notebook (HR_Analytics_Attrition_Prediction.ipynb): Implements data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and machine learning models for attrition prediction.

Dashboard (Elevate_bi.pdf): Power BI dashboard showcasing key HR metrics, attrition distribution, and employee demographics.

üîç Objectives
----------------

Analyze HR data to identify factors contributing to employee attrition.

Build predictive models to forecast the likelihood of attrition.

Provide data-driven insights for HR to improve retention strategies.

Visualize employee demographics and attrition patterns in an interactive dashboard.


‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
-------------------

Data Exploration & Cleaning

Checked for missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

Encoded categorical features and scaled numerical ones.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Employee demographics: Age, gender, department, job role.

Attrition patterns by department, age band, gender, etc.

Predictive Modeling

Machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).

Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Visualization & Insights

Power BI dashboard highlights:
---------------------------------

Total Employees: 1,470

Attrition Count: 237

Attrition Rate: ~16%

Attrition by age, gender, job role, and department.

üìä Key Insights
------------------

Majority of attrition occurs among employees aged 26‚Äì35.

Male employees show higher attrition rates than females.

Certain job roles (e.g., Sales Executives, Laboratory Technicians) are more prone to attrition.

The Sales and Research departments experience the highest turnover.

Explore Elevate_bi.pdf for visual insights into attrition trends.

üìà Future Improvements
-------------------------

Deploy the ML model as an API or dashboard integration.

Use advanced models (XGBoost, Neural Networks) for higher accuracy.

Incorporate additional employee engagement/survey data.

Real-time attrition risk monitoring.
